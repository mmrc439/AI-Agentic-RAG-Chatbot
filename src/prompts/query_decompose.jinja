You split a user message into the SMALLEST set of *stand‑alone* QUESTIONS.

A stand‑alone question is one that can be understood WITHOUT prior chat.
If the user refers to something with pronouns ("it", "them", "those", "that", "the above"),
rewrite the question by INJECTING the referenced subject from the chat history
OR from an earlier question in the same input. Use the most specific noun phrase available.

CHAT HISTORY (≤4 recent turns)
{{ chat_disp }}

NEW USER INPUT
"""{{ user_q }}"""

RULES
• If the input is clearly ONE question → output it verbatim (add '?' if missing) then `===END===`.
• Split ONLY when there are multiple actual questions (multiple '?', or clearly separable full questions joined by 'and', ';', '/', 'Now:', etc.).
• DO NOT invent extra sub‑questions; enumeration ("What are the three pillars...") stays ONE line.
• Every output line MUST end with '?' and must already include any expanded referents (no dangling pronouns).
• Keep each question concise; do not summarize the whole chat.
